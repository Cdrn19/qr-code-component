## My process

In the development of this project we tried to make a resemblance to the original looking for the perfection of each pixel. 

Use certain tools to measure each pixel corresponding to your block to make a very exact match. 

Don't consider doing any responsive implementations, the project looks perfect on mobile devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use tools and principles where you use plain code as long as it depends on the context for which it is being developed.

Since this is a simple project, use the simplest possible code. 

### Continued development

I want to learn even more about the **box-shadow** property, i still don't know how to decipher it to perform this type of challenge .

In this challenge it was used for this section:

```html
<div>
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="">
  <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building porjects</h2>
  <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
</div>
```
```css
div {
    width: 320px;
    padding: 16px;
    background-color: var(--White);
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: rgba(149, 157, 165, 0.2) 0px 8px 24px;
}
```

### Useful resources
